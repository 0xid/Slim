Slim

Welcome to Slim! Slim is a micro-framework for PHP 5 inspired by the Sinatra framework for Ruby. Slim includes the following features:

- Compatible with PHP 5 (PHP 5 >= 5.3 recommended)
- Clean and simple PHP syntax
- RESTful routing (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
- Before and after callbacks
- Easy-to-extend templating (use Smarty, Twig, or whatever you want)
- Halt with custom status code and message
- Easily modify the HTTP request and response

Here is a Hello World application written with Slim:

<?php

//Require Slim
require('slim/Slim.php');
 
//Initialize Slim
Slim::init();
  
//Define routes (PHP 5 >= 5.3)
Slim::get('/hello/:name', function ($name) {
	echo "Hello! Your name is $name and you are using PHP 5.3";
});

//Define routes (PHP 5 < 5.3)
Slim::get('/hello/:name', 'example_hello');
function example_hello($name) {
	echo "Hello! Your name is $name and you are not using PHP 5.3";
}

//Run Slim
Slim::run();

?>
