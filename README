Slim PHP5 Micro-framework (A Sinatra Clone)

Welcome to Slim! Slim is a micro PHP5 framework modeled after Sinatra. You can read the full Slim documentation and see code examples at:

http://slim.joshlockhart.com/

Slim includes the following features:

- RESTful GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routing
- Before and after callbacks
- Easy-to-extend templating (use Smarty, Twig, or whatever you want)

Slim is still in active development and has not been fully tested.

Slim is released under the MIT LICENSE.

Thanks!
